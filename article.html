                    <p>
                        India Gate's historical importance lies in its role as a solemn war memorial, <br>
                        commemorating over 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War, with their names inscribed on its walls.<br>
                        Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it serves as a symbol of national sacrifice, patriotism, and remembrance, later becoming home to the Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier) for fallen Indian soldiers,<br>
                        making it a significant landmark for national ceremonies and a poignant reminder of valor.

                    <p>
                        The monument commemorates the legacy of British colonial rule, namely the first visit of a British monarch to India<br>
                        and its use as an entry point for prominent colonial personnel into British India. Today the Gateway is synonymous with the city of Mumbai.
