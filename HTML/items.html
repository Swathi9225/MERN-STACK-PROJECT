                ranging from Indian-style spicy preparations <wbr>(often a dry stir-fry or deep-fried starter)<br>
                to classic Southern-style buttermilk fried chicken. Key steps generally involve marinating the chicken in seasonings,<br>
                 sometimes with a coating or batter, and then frying until cooked through and crispy.<br>
