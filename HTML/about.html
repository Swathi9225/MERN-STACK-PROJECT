    <p>India is a land of great diversity 
        in languages, religions, cultures, foods and traditions.
        <em>which is why india is known as "unity in diversity".</em>
        <p><h4><small>INDIAN DIVERSITY</small></h4>
            India's diversity is a profound mix of cultures, languages, religions, and ethnicities, famously described <br>
            as "unity in diversity," stemming from varied geography, history, and peoples (Indo-Aryans, Dravidians, Mongoloids, <br>
            tribal groups). This richness is seen in its 22 official languages (out of thousands of dialects), multiple religions <br>
            (Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism),
            diverse cuisines, clothing, festivals, and traditions, creating a vibrant, plural society.

            <h4><small>INDIAN HERITAGE</small></h4>
            India's heritage is a vast, diverse tapestry woven from millennia of history, cultures, religions <br>
            (Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, etc.), and empires, featuring tangible wonders like the Taj Mahal and<br>
             ancient temples, alongside vibrant intangible traditions in music, dance (Bharatnatyam, Kathak),<br>
              festivals (Diwali, Holi), cuisine, philosophy (Yoga, Karma), and textiles, all united by a spirit of<cite> "Unity in Diversity" <br>
              that blends influences from the Indus Valley Civilization to the Mughals and beyond, creating a rich legacy <br>
            </cite>still facing modern preservation challenges.
