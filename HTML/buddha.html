        Philosophy examines the rich intellectual tradition that stems from the Buddha’s direct insights into the nature of mind and reality.<br>
         Genuine practice requires investigations of core philosophical concepts like emptiness, impermanence, and non-self that form the foundation of Buddhist understanding.<br>
          Direct study reveals how philosophical inquiry is not mere intellectual exercise but a vital tool for cutting through confusion and cultivating wisdom. Buddhist philosophy remains profoundly relevant today,<br>
           offering analytical tools and insights that can transform our fundamental relationship with ourselves and the world.

      <h4>Buddha's spiritual journey</h4>
        Buddha's spiritual journey began as Prince Siddhartha Gautama, sheltered from suffering, who renounced his luxurious life after witnessing old age, sickness, and death, leading him to seek liberation from life's inevitable sorrows through asceticism, meditation, and deep contemplation,<br>
         culminating in his awakening (Enlightenment or Bodhi) under the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya, where he understood the Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path, transforming him into the Buddha, the "Enlightened One," and inspiring his lifelong mission to teach others the path to Nirvana (cessation of suffering).
